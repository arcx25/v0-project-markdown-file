                <h3>Anonymous Registration</h3>
                <p>
                    Create an account using only a PGP key. No email, no phone, 
                    no personal information required. Your cryptographic key is 
                    your identity.

                <h3>Post or Browse Opportunities</h3>
                <p>
                    Buyers post opportunities. Vendors browse listings and express 
                    interest. The system facilitates matching without revealing 
                    identities until both parties agree.

                <p>

                    and proposals, then choose their preferred vendor to work with.

                <p>
                    All messages are end-to-end encrypted with PGP. Even we cannot 
                    read your communications. Transaction details shared through 
                    encrypted channels only.
